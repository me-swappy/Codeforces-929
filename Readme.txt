This is a repository in which I'm presenting solutions of problems of codeforces round 929 div. 3 https://codeforces.com/contest/1933
Solutions are presented from problem A to F.
I hope you get some insightful ideas from them.
These are my submissions during contests , so maybe they can be little bit messy.
